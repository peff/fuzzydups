fuzzymunge(1)
============

NAME
----
fuzzymunge - Convert inputs lines to fuzzy matches

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
fuzzymunge [limitopts] [-b <base>] [-i <input> ...] [-o <output> ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Fuzzymunge reads a set of "base" records from stdin, one per line,
ending with a blank line. It then reads a set of "input" records from
stdin. For each input record, the closest match from the set of base
records is printed to stdout. If no match is found below the edit
distance limit, a warning is printed to stderr and the input record is
printed unchanged.

Input/Output Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-b <file>:: Read base records from <file> instead of from stdin.

-i <file>:: Read input records from <file> instead of from stdin.

-o <file>:: Write output to <file> instead of to stdout.

Multiple input and output files can be given. If both are given, the
number of input and output files must be equal. The contents of the
first input file are munged into the first output file, and so on.
This can be more efficient than invoking fuzzymunge multiple times, as
the base records need only be read and sorted once.

EXAMPLES
--------

Correct a stale list based on a master database. Note that we correct
"baz" to "bar", but mark "bogus" as uncorrectable.

-----------------------------------------
$ cat good-words
foo
bar
moof
whee

$ cat input
foo
baz
bogus

$ fuzzymunge -b good-words -l 1 <input >output
warning: no match for 'bogus'
$ cat output
foo
bar
bogus
