============

NAME
----
fuzzymunge - Convert inputs lines to fuzzy matches

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
fuzzymunge [limitopts] [-b <base>] [-i] [<file...>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Fuzzymunge reads a set of "base" records from stdin, one per line,
ending with a blank line. It then reads a set of "input" records from
stdin. For each input record, the closest match from the set of base
records is printed to stdout. If no match is found below the edit
distance limit, a warning is printed to stderr and the input record is
printed unchanged.

Input/Output Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-b <file>:: Read base records from <file> instead of from stdin.

-i:: Edit files in-place.

<files...>::
A list of files to read as input. If `-i` is not used, the munged
contents are written to stdout. If `-i` is used, each file is read,
written to a tempfile, and the tempfile atomically renamed over the
original.

EXAMPLES
--------

Correct a stale list based on a master database. Note that we correct
"baz" to "bar", but mark "bogus" as uncorrectable.

-----------------------------------------
$ cat good-words
foo
bar
moof
whee

$ cat input
foo
baz
bogus

$ fuzzymunge -b good-words -l 1 <input >output
warning: no match for 'bogus'
$ cat output
foo
bar
bogus
