Limit Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-l <num>:: Use a static edit distance limit of <num>. This means that
           two records are considered to match if they differ by a
           combined total of at most <num> additions, deletions, or
           substitutions.

-d <num>:: Use a dynamic edit distance, in which for every <num>
           characters in the input string, we increase the allowable
           edit distance by 1. This helps avoid false positives in very
           short strings, while still allowing a reasonable number of
           edits in longer strings.

-m <num>:: Set the maximum allowable dynamic edit distance to <num>. The
           higher the edit distance, the more time we must spend
           analyzing strings. For long strings which would have a very
           high edit distance, this reduces the amount of time we spend
           finding that they do not match.

The default limit is `-d 5 -m 3`.
